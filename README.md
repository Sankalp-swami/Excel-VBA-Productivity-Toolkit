3. Filter Rows by Highlighted Color in Pivot Tables
File Name: FilterRowsByColor.vba

Description:
This VBA function allows users to filter and analyze only the rows highlighted in a specific color (e.g., green) within an Excel dataset. Since Excel does not natively support filtering by cell color in Pivot Tables, this script provides a helper function to check whether an entire row is filled with a specific color. It then labels each row accordingly, enabling filtering in Pivot Tables or other data analysis.

Usage:

Download and Import the VBA Script:

Open the VBA Editor (ALT + F11).
Select File > Import File... and choose FilterRowsByColor.vba.
Apply the Function in Excel:

In a new column (e.g., "Row Color"), enter the formula:
excel
Copy
Edit
=IsRowGreen(A2:D2)
Adjust A2:D2 to match your datasetâ€™s full row range.
Drag down to apply the formula across all rows.
Use in a Pivot Table:

Select the dataset (including the "Row Color" column).
Insert a Pivot Table (Insert > PivotTable).
Drag "Row Color" to the Filters area.
Filter the Pivot Table to show only "Green" rows.
Why Use This Script?
âœ… Enables Pivot Table filtering based on row color.
âœ… Automates color-based analysis without manual sorting.
âœ… Helps in reviewing specific highlighted data efficiently.

4. Analyze Workbook References
File Name: AnalyzeWorkbookReferences.bas

Description:
This VBA script provides a comprehensive analysis of tab references in an Excel workbook. It identifies:

Tabs Referencing Each Tab: Lists all tabs that reference the current tab in their formulas.
Tabs Referenced by Each Tab: Lists all tabs referenced within the current tab's formulas.
The output is summarized in a new worksheet, "Workbook References Summary", with columns for the tab name, referencing tabs, and referenced tabs. Handles complex formulas with multiple tab references, self-references, and ensures compatibility with large workbooks.
